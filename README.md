SwiftyNotes is a [website](https://swiftynotes.com), built using the [Swift programming language](https://www.swift.org), to provide quick _idiomatic tips_ on the Swift languageâ€”aka writing _Swifty_ code (yes, Swifty is a real term used). This repo contains the code that generates the website. There are some pretty nerdy things in here to check out such as the fact that the code snippets are 100% valid Swift that are compiled before the site is generated.

I've learned so much from the Swift community. My hope is to give a little back with this project.

Contributions of any kind are most welcome. Even feel free to [contribute a new tip](#contribute-a-tip) ðŸ¤“.

## Contribute a Tip
If interested, create a pull request (PR) with a tip of your own! The below sections will help you get started with the code base, but here are the high level steps to contribute a new tip.
1. Create a new folder in the [Notes](./Modules/SwiftyNotesSite/src/Notes) folder named with the date to publish your tip (format: yyyy-mm-dd).
1. Add the tip's metadata json file. This is the content for the tip (e.g., title and body). [Here is an example](./Modules/SwiftyNotesSite/src/Notes/2023-02-24/if_case_let_syntax.snippet.metadata.json).
1. Add the tip's code snippet. This needs to be valid Swift code and should compliment the metadata above. [Here is an example](./Modules/SwiftyNotesSite/src/Notes/2023-02-24/if_case_let_syntax.snippet.swift).
1. Make sure your tip is generated as expected by following the below [getting started](#getting-started) guide.
1. Make a PR with your new tip!

## Getting Started
To test out the SwiftyNotes website locally
- Open terminal
- Clone this repo
  + `git clone https://github.com/jasonzurita/swiftynotes`
- Change directories to the cloned project
  + `cd <path>/swiftynotes`
- Generate the website
  + `swift run`
- Open the generated website in your browser
  + `open _site/index.html`

That's it ðŸ¥³. Make changes to the site, do a `swift run`, and refresh your browser!

## Tech Stack
There are two main [Swift modules](https://github.com/jasonzurita/swiftynotes/blob/main/Package.swift) in this repo: the website, and the HTML eDSL.

### [The HTML eDSL](https://github.com/jasonzurita/swiftynotes/tree/main/Modules/SwiftHtmlCss)
The HTML embedded domain specific language (eDSL) was build using Swift's [Result Builders](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10253/) to be _SwiftUI_ like in its syntax (with a little work, this library can be made public for other websites!). Knowing [about HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) will help in knowing the provided elements like _body_ and what styles to use.

**Example from the SwiftyNotes site:**
```swift
Html {
    Head(title: "SwiftyNotes", cssStyleFileName: "CodeColors.css")
    Body {
        SiteHeader()
        SiteNotes()
        Footer {
            P("Jason Zurita &copy; 2023 | Built in Swift and ") {
                A(copy: "open source.", url: "https://github.com/jasonzurita/swiftynotes")
            }
        }
        .textAlign(.center)
        .color(.mediumGray)
    }
    .font(.apple)
    .textAlign(.center)
    .background(.color(.lightGray))
    .margin(0)
    .padding(0)
}
```

### [The website module](https://github.com/jasonzurita/swiftynotes/tree/main/Modules/SwiftyNotesSite/src)
This module consumes the above HTML eDSL module. The result is a fully Swift defined site along with styling. When `swift run` is invoked, this module runs as an executable and [generates HTML](https://github.com/jasonzurita/swiftynotes/blob/5e0c0d977e13b0b3c995b44df63c152c7a759f43/Modules/SwiftyNotesSite/src/main.swift#L9) that is ready to be statically hosted and consumed by browsers.

#### Deployment
The website is hosted on [CloudFlare pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) as a static website. When a new commit is _pushed_ to the main branch, CloudFlare runs a `swift run` and takes the output generated HTML and hosts it. Pretty much that simple.
