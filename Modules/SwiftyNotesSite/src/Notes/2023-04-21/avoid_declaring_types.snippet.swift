// Leveraging Swift's type inference (Swifty-er!)
let seven = 7 // type is an int
let sevenPointZero = 7.0 // type is a double
let luckyNumbers = [7, 7, 7] // type is an Array<Int>

// Mostly bias away from doing this
let five: Int = 5
let fivePointZero: Double = 5.0
let maybeLuckyNumbers: [Int] = [5, 5, 5]
